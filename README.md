# Google Sheet Languages Model - i18n google sheet layer

`google-sheet-languages-model` is a npm package that allows you to download/upload and parse internationalization (i18n) data between a Google Sheet and your local environment. This readme provides instructions on how to set up and use the `google-sheet-languages-model` package to manage your i18n data.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
yarn add -D google-sheet-languages-model googleapis
```

## Authorization

It's recommended to use the [Service Account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account) auth option to interact with the Google Sheets API. Follow these steps to set up the authorization:

1. Enable the Google Sheets API permission for your project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new Service Account or use an existing one, and add it as a editor to your working sheet.
3. Download the `credentials.json` file which is generated from the Service Account and place it in your project directory.
4. Share your Google Sheet with the email address provided in the `client_email` field inside the `credentials.json` file.
5. Set the Google Sheet ID in your environment variables or configuration.

## Usage

Firstly, import the necessary modules from the package and your configuration:

```typescript
import { GoogleSheetLanguagesModel } from "google-sheet-languages-model";
import { SHEET_ID, languages, auth, folderPath } from "./config.ts";
```

### Download and Parse Data to Local

Here is an example of how to download and parse i18n data from a Google Sheet and save it to a local folder:

```typescript
const googleSheetLanguagesModel = new GoogleSheetLanguagesModel({
  sheetId: SHEET_ID,
  auth,
});

const languagesModel = await googleSheetLanguagesModel.loadFromGoogleSheet(
  "Test",
  languages
);

languagesModel.saveToFolder(folderPath, "nest");

console.log("pull done");
```

### Upload Data to Google Sheet

Here is an example of how to upload i18n data from a local folder to a Google Sheet:

```typescript
const languagesModel = GoogleSheetLanguagesModel.loadFromFolder(
  folderPath,
  languages
);

const googleSheetLanguagesModel = new GoogleSheetLanguagesModel({
  sheetId: SHEET_ID,
  auth,
});

await googleSheetLanguagesModel.saveToGoogleSheet("Test", languagesModel);

console.log("push done");
```

### Configuration

Your `config.ts` should export the following variables:

- `SHEET_ID`: The ID of your Google Sheet.
- `languages`: An array of language codes (e.g., `['en', 'es', 'fr']`).
- `auth`: Your authorization credentials.
- `folderPath`: The path to the folder where you want to save or load the language files.

### Examples

- Pull i18n from google sheet to local folder. ([link](https://github.com/neil585456525/i18n-google-sheet-example/blob/main/example/pull.ts))
- Push i18n from local folder to google sheet. ([link](https://github.com/neil585456525/i18n-google-sheet-example/blob/main/example/push.ts))

## Documentation

The main classes and methods are documented in the source code provided. This will guide you on the data structures and the methods available for use.

Feel free to explore the provided code to better understand how to work with the `google-sheet-languages-model` package to manage your i18n data.

## Data Structures for i18n File Data

The `google-sheet-languages-model` package supports two different structures to describe i18n file data: `nest` (JS object style) and `flat` (key annotation style). Both styles serve to organize your internationalization data in a manner that best suits your project's needs.

### 1. Nest (JS Object Style)

In the `nest` structure, i18n data is organized in a nested JavaScript object format, where each key represents a nesting level. This structure is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it a good choice for projects with a hierarchical data organization.

Example:

```javascript
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Name",
    "age": "Age"
  },
  "messages": {
    "welcome": "Welcome"
  }
}
```

### 2. Flat (Key Annotation Style)

The `flat` structure, on the other hand, uses a single-level object with keys representing the path to the value in a dot notation. This structure is simple and often preferred in projects with a flat data organization.

Example:

```javascript
{
  "user.name": "Name",
  "user.age": "Age",
  "messages.welcome": "Welcome"
}
```

You can choose either of these structures based on your project requirements. The method `languagesModel.saveToFolder(folderPath, structureStyle)` allows you to specify the structure style as `'nest'` or `'flat'` when saving the i18n data to a local folder. Similarly, when loading data from a folder using `GoogleSheetLanguagesModel.loadFromFolder(folderPath, languages, structureStyle)`, you can specify the structure style to match the organization of your i18n data.

Example:

```typescript
// Saving data in nest structure
languagesModel.saveToFolder(folderPath, "nest");

// Or, saving data in flat structure
languagesModel.saveToFolder(folderPath, "flat");
```

This flexibility allows you to work with the i18n data in a way that's most convenient and logical for your project's organization.
